<h2>What's The Challenge</h2>
<p>
Marine resources, both coastal and oceanic,
provide irreplaceable benefits and services
that align with the World Bank Group’s twin
goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity. The 2017 UN Ocean
Conference estimated that 37 percent of the 
2 2019 ANNUAL REPORT
world’s population lives in coastal communities,
many of which are dependent on oceans
for health, nutrition, sustainable livelihoods,
and decent work. Oceans are also drivers of
sustainable, long-term economic growth and
environmental stability, which highlights the
significance of protecting ocean, marine, and
coastal resources for the benefit of all.
<p/>

<p>
In part, the significance of oceans for
sustainable global development is a result of
the wide range of economic activities that
oceans support. Fisheries are an obvious
example of an ocean resource that drives global
growth, but other significant sectors include
maritime shipping, which facilitates most global
trade, energy generation and extraction via
offshore wind farms and drilling platforms,
and tourism and recreation, which in many
developing countries and SIDS is a central
driver of growth.
</p>

<p>
However, oceans are in crisis: marine pollution
and plastic litter, along with the growing
impacts of climate change, endanger marine
ecosystems, the health of coastal communities,
and the resources and services that drive
growth. Furthermore, growing demand
for oceanic and land-based resources may
worsen existing overexploitation of ocean
resources and services while increasing plastic
consumption and litter flows. Without a
coordinated response, these threats will further
deplete fisheries (of which over 30 percent are
overfished), destroy coastal wetlands, and cause
pernicious effects on the natural assets that
attract tourism to coastal communities. These
challenges are exacerbated by governance
problems, especially in areas beyond national
jurisdiction, and usage conflicts among sectors,
which can be resolved only through improved
and better integrated management.
