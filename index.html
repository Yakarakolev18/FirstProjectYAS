<div class="text">Oceans cover two-thirds of the planet’s surface. They touch all human life, providing
nutrition, livelihoods, climate regulation, and recreation. Policy makers and governments
are giving increasing attention to the importance of oceans and ocean resources as
drivers of economic growth and providers of key ecosystem services that improve quality
of life. As the international community is looking with heightened urgency at the broad
threats to oceans, which include overexploitation, overdevelopment, pollution including
plastics from land-based and marine sources, and climate change, it has become
apparent that oceanic sectors must be developed in a holistic and integrated fashion.

<h3>National Ocean Servise</h3>
 <div class="text3"><p>The ocean economy includes businesses dependent on ocean and Great Lakes natural resources. A study released earlier this year demonstrates that this essential segment of the U.S. economy employs more than three million people—more than crop production, telecommunication and building construction combined—with more than two thirds of those employees in the tourism and recreation sector.</p>


The ocean and Great Lakes economy is comprised of six job sectors dependent on natural resources:  marine construction, marine transportation, offshore mineral extraction, ship and boat building, and tourism and recreation.
